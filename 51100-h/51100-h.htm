<h2><a name="WAR_AND_TELEGRAPHY" id="WAR_AND_TELEGRAPHY">WAR AND TELEGRAPHY.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is vexing, even saddening, to think how large an
amount of discovery, invention, and skill is applied
to the murderous purposes of war. As we advance
in civilisation, armies become larger and larger,
and more abundantly supplied with agencies we
would willingly see devoted to more peaceful purposes.
Whether wars of race, wars of creed, wars
of ambition, or wars of national vanity, the result
is much about the same in this respect. Some
consolers tell us that wars by-and-by will become
so terrible as to check the desire to wage them: let
us hope so, despite present symptoms.</p>

<p>Science has unquestionably rendered a vast
amount of aid to attack and defence in war within
the last few years. Gunpowder, gun-cotton, dynamite,
and other explosive substances for fire-arms,
torpedoes, and military mining have had their
properties and relative powers investigated with
remarkable completeness. Gun-carriages have been
so vastly improved, that by Captain Scott's contrivances
a six-hundred-pounder can be managed
as easily and quickly as a thirty-two-pounder
could in the days of our fathers or grandfathers;
while by Major Moncrieff's automatic apparatus a
gun lowers itself behind the screen of a parapet
or earthen battery for loading, and then raises itself
twelve or fifteen feet to fire over it.</p>

<p>Photography, again, is applied in a great variety
of ways to aid warlike operations. At the office of
the Ordnance Survey, or under the supervision of
the Director, an amazing number of such photographs
are taken, enlarged or reduced from the
original dimensions according to circumstances, and
multiplied or prepared for printing by a very
rapid process of zincography or some other kind
of electro-engraving. One of the Reports issued
by the Director tells us that he supplies the War
Office with photographs of plans of battles, important
fortified posts and their surrounding districts,
barracks and forts in all parts of the British dominions,
&amp;c. All the equipments of troops for the
field are similarly photographed or zincographed,
as unerring patterns for reference. For such wars
as we have been engaged in during the past five-and-twenty
years (happily few in number), such as
the Crimean, Abyssinian, and Ashanti campaigns,
photographs and zincographs have been supplied
in large number to the officers, illustrating all
details which the home authorities have been able
to ascertain, and which are likely to be useful in
the intended operations.</p>

<p>What are we to say of the <i>torpedo</i>, and its
management by electricity? This is really a
wonderful subject, the influence of which on future
naval warfare even the most skilled and experienced
officers can only dimly surmise. We know
that during the civil war in America, the Federal
torpedoes wrought more destruction on the Confederate
ships than all the guns in the Federal
fleet; that, on the other hand, the Confederate
torpedoes so effectually guarded the approach to
Richmond up James River, that a hostile flotilla
was compelled to retire baffled and disappointed.
One unlucky Federal ship unwittingly passed over
a submerged torpedo at the moment of explosion.
And with what result? 'The hull of the ship
was visibly lifted out of the water, the boiler
exploded, the smoke-funnels were carried away,
and the crew projected into the air with extreme
velocity. Out of the crew of one hundred and
twenty-seven men, only three remained alive&mdash;the
vessel itself being blown to atoms.' The
arrangements have been so much improved since
that time, that messages can be sent across a river
or estuary from shore to shore through the very
wire which is to discharge the torpedo! In every
naval war during the last few years, torpedoes
have been more or less employed. In what way
the weaker Russian fleet has been able to baffle
the stronger fleet of the Turks in the struggle of
1877, the newspapers have told us in full detail.
There is no necessity for pursuing this part of the
subject further, seeing that it was lately treated
with some degree of fullness in our pages.</p>

<p>But the greatest marvel of all, in regard to the
application of electricity to warlike purposes, is
the <i>electric telegraph</i>. We know what service the
lightning-messenger renders to society generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">{738}</a></span>
in the peaceful daily maintenance of commercial
and social intercommunication; and military men
now know what a potent instrument it is in the
conduct of field-operations and siege-works. An
officer well qualified to judge affirms that the
memorable Franco-German War, so disastrous to
France, could not have been carried on without
the aid of the electric telegraph by the German
forces. The warlike struggles engaged in by
various European powers in the Crimea, in India
during the Mutiny, in China, in New Zealand, in
the Austro-Italian provinces, in Morocco by the
Spaniards, in America by the Federals and the
Confederates, in Holstein during the brief Dano-German
War, in Bohemia during the still briefer
Austro-Prussian War, in Abyssinia, in France
during the struggle against the Germans, in
Ashanti&mdash;all these were marked by the adoption
of the electric telegraph to a greater or less extent.</p>

<p>Many of us remember, from the vivid descriptions
written by the special correspondents of the
daily newspapers, how terrible were the sufferings
of the British troops in the Crimea during the
winter of 1854-5, engaged in trench-work and
other siege-operations under almost every kind of
privation. But we also know how impossible it
would have been to learn the news quickly in
England and to send instructions, without the aid
of telegraphy. An electric cable was for this very
purpose submerged in the Black Sea from the
Turkish mainland to the Crimea; while on land,
wires were set up from Balaklava to the headquarters
outside Sebastopol. Thus it was that
daily messages could be exchanged between Lord
Raglan's headquarters and the War Office in London&mdash;also
between the special correspondents of the
daily papers and their employers in Fleet Street or
Printing House Square. So in like manner, during
the struggle arising out of the Indian Mutiny, the
advancing British columns contrived, wherever
possible, to maintain unbroken telegraphic communication
with Calcutta, whereby the viceroy
was kept informed of what was going on. Of
course the mutineers or rebels destroyed or disrupted
the wires wherever and whenever they
could; and to repair the damage thus inflicted
formed no small part of the arduous duties of the
British officers.</p>

<p>Our little but expensive war in Abyssinia in
1868, marked by a less shedding of blood than
almost any other war in modern times, was an
engineers' war from first to last. A wild and
unknown country was surveyed and accurately
mapped out, four hundred miles of road constructed,
tube-wells sunk, photographs of various
useful kinds taken, and a telegraphic system
established. The telegraphic arrangements first
made had to be abandoned, owing to the scantiness
of the facilities for transporting the necessary
materials. The more restricted plan actually
adopted was difficult enough, so limited were the
means of obtaining wood for telegraph poles. On
approaching Magdala, however, Captain St John
(who had the management of this part of the
engineering) succeeded in laying down from five
to ten miles a day. Short as was the war, this
telegraph conveyed more than seven thousand
eight hundred messages during the five months of
its working, and aided most materially in giving
effect to General (now Lord) Napier's well-planned
and successful scheme of operations.</p>

<p>Our strange Ashanti War gave further evidence
of the formation of a telegraph line through a
wild country inhabited by a barbarous people.
Lieutenant Jekyll, who had the management of
this work, has given a lively account of the difficulties
that beset him, and his mode of overcoming
them. It was at first intended to fight the
war with native levies and to lay down a railway;
but Sir Garnet Wolseley, on landing to take the
command, soon found that the natives were not
sufficiently reliable, that the country was almost
impracticable for a railway, that he must have
English troops, and that an electric telegraph
would be a highly useful aid. Lieutenant Jekyll,
with a small staff, went inland and bought bamboo
canes of the blacks, set them up as posts, and laid
his wires from Cape Coast Castle to Coomassie at
the rate of about two miles a day. A gang of
fifty natives helped him. Of these worthies he
says: 'They were not promising in appearance,
and I was compelled to dispense with the services of
those who were <i>less than four feet high</i>! (We italicise
these words to shew what pigmies many of the
West Africans are.) But they had with them an
intelligent headman; and by dint of supervision,
supplemented by a little flogging once now and
then, turned out a tolerably useful body for light
work, as niggers go.' The line was extended by
degrees as far as Accrofumu, about a hundred
miles from the coast. An amusing proof was
afforded of the tendency of the natives to regard
the telegraph as a kind of fetich, charm, or spell.
The English one day saw bits of white cotton-thread
suspended from tree to tree for several miles,
as if to obtain thereby some of the mysterious benefits
which the white man evidently expected from
the wire. When the native helpers received small
electric shocks occasionally, consequent on the testing
or using of the line, they made sure that a charm
was at work; and the lieutenant was half afraid
his men would run away in terror. The climate
was very trying to the English, who, lying ill
with fever, got the natives to rouse them when
any movements of the receiving apparatus were
observed. Nevertheless, this telegraphic line
rendered services much more than compensatory
for the expense, difficulty, and anxiety of laying,
maintaining, and using it.</p>

<p>The truly wonderful and eventful Franco-German
War of 1870-1 exhibited the value of
electro-telegraphy with a completeness never
equalled before or since. A foretaste had been
given in the Austro-Prussian or 'Seven Weeks'
War' of 1866; when four complete and distinct
telegraphic organisations were adopted&mdash;one with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">{739}</a></span>
Prince Frederick-William's fine army; one with
that of Prince Charles; one at the king's headquarters;
and one in reserve. Each could lay
down wires as fast as the headquarters could
advance. The speedy termination of the war
averted the necessity of constructing field-telegraphs,
such as those about to be described.</p>

<p>When the German forces advanced to Paris in
the closing months of 1870, the plan pursued
with the telegraph was as follows: The ordinary
commercial and railway telegraphs were gradually
extended over the frontier into France, as the
German armies advanced. The field or <i>étappen</i> telegraphs
maintained communication between the
base of operations, the ammunition dépôts, and the
advanced columns of the various army corps. When
the sappers and miners had pushed on to the vicinity
of Paris, the ubiquitous wire travelled with them.
The materials used were light and simple; the
operators employed to transmit and receive messages
had been trained in the state establishments;
and headquarters were kept instantly informed
of any observed movements on the part of the
French. The telegraph was indeed in constant
use by the Germans&mdash;for arranging the transport
of ammunition; for hourly communication with
the commissariat; for directing the conveyance to
Germany of sick and wounded, as well as prisoners;
for regulating the traffic on the field railways; for
maintaining unbroken connection between the
troops, which formed a belt of ninety miles' circumference
around Paris; for summoning reinforcements
to any point where suddenly needed;
and to send news of any gap in the continuity
of the immense ring of soldiers encircling the
beleaguered city.</p>

<p>If any evidence were needed of the invaluable
services rendered by the electric telegraph in the
war just noticed, it was furnished by M. Von
Chauvin, who attended before a Committee of the
House of Commons on Postal Telegraphs in 1876.
He stated in distinct terms that the war could not
have been carried on without this potent aid.</p>

<p>Our own English system of war telegraphy,
organised at Chatham, has been improved from
time to time. Light iron telegraph poles are provided,
to support insulated wires. There is a
travelling office on wheels for the operators; while
the materials are carried in specially constructed
wagons. So strong is the wire that wheels may
go over it; and therefore the line is laid above
ground or <i>on</i> the ground according to circumstances.
Spikes of peculiar form enable the
wires to be hung on trees or walls to meet the
contingencies of towns and villages. The nucleus
of the staff of operators is a small body of Royal
Engineers, under their own officers, comprising
about fifty military men, with occasional assistance
from others&mdash;well organised into superintendents,
inspectors, clerks, linesmen, storemen, artisans, and
labourers. The wagons for materials contain
drums on which the wire is coiled; this is unrolled
as the wagon moves on, which is as fast as the
operators can lay the line. At the present time,
ten thousand miles of prepared wire are said to be
kept in store, ready for any exigences.</p>

<p>We might go on to notice the aid furnished to
warlike operations by the electric light; as for
instance, at Paris in the closing weeks of 1870,
when such a light on Montmartre enabled the
Parisians to gather some knowledge of what the
besiegers were about at night. But enough: the
brief summary above given will suffice to shew
how electricity is used in war.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.&mdash;WILFRED'S LETTER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> went by, and nothing happened to justify
Mabel's fears. Wilfred seemed to be working hard
and getting on well. His talent was pronounced
unmistakable by the master under whom he was
placed, and he himself was in good spirits about
his future. But before very long matters began to
change. His letters to Mabel were less frequent
and shorter than they had been; he spoke with
less openness and frankness of his doings; and it
was evident to her that there was a <i>something</i>
which he was careful to keep from her.</p>

<p>She longed to see Mr Merton, to hear from him
what news he had of his son, and whether his
ideas about Wilfred corresponded with her own;
but she dared not speak to him about it. She
knew how hard he had always been to Wilfred,
how intolerant of all his faults; and she knew
well there would be little mercy to be hoped for
him at his father's hands if, as she suspected, he
had been taking more to pleasure and less to work
lately. She dared not even speak to her father of
what she feared, for could she expect even him to
think as leniently of her dear one as she did? So
she had to go on from day to day keeping her
trouble&mdash;which was not less difficult to bear because
it was only suspected&mdash;to herself.</p>

<p>At last, when Wilfred had been about nine
months in Paris, but too certain proof arrived of
how true her suspicions had been. Mr Colherne
was staying away from home&mdash;a very unusual
proceeding, and Mabel was left alone. He had
gone to pass a few days with a friend in Scotland,
whither it had been impracticable for his
daughter to accompany him.</p>

<p>The morning after his departure, Mabel came
down to breakfast rather later than usual, singing
a snatch of one of her favourite ditties, and burst
open the dining-room door in a way that was
indicative of her lively feelings. Her eye lighted
upon a letter that was lying in her plate; the
writing was that of Wilfred Merton. The missive
was almost illegible and very brief, and acted
upon her gay spirits like a sudden freezing. It
ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My darling Mabel</span>&mdash;I must write a few
words, the last you will ever have from me, to tell
you that whatever may appear, however any one
may try to persuade you, I still love you; love
you, as I have done all my life, with all the best
part of my nature. Believe that, Mabel, my own,
always. I write to say good-bye, for I shall never
see you again; and yet I never longed to see you
as I do at this moment. I feel half mad now,
and hardly know what I am writing. How shall I
say it; I have nothing to live for, except disgrace,
and I will not live for that, I am resolved. Once
more, good-bye, dearest and best. Try to forgive
me, and then forget me, as every one else in the
world will soon do.</p>

<p class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Wilfred Merton.</span>
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">{740}</a></span></p>

<p>For an instant Mabel sat quite still, gazing
straight before her with one expression, that of
blank despair, upon her face. This sudden fearful
shock had quite stunned her. But she was not a
girl to remain inactive, simply grieving over misfortune,
when there was anything to be done. Her
resolution was promptly taken. She rang, and a
servant appeared.</p>

<p>'Tell Hawkesley to bring the brougham round
as soon as he possibly can,' she said; 'tell him not
to mind how it looks, but to be at the door as
soon as possible.'</p>

<p>'Is anything the matter, miss?' said the man,
astonished at this order.</p>

<p>'Yes. I have no time to lose.'</p>

<p>'Is it master, miss?' he asked, with that
dreadful habit of his class of questioning instead
of doing what is wanted.</p>

<p>'No; papa is quite well. But don't stop now; go
yourself to the stable; I haven't a minute to waste.'</p>

<p>In a few minutes more she was seated in the
brougham which was fast making its way to Mr
Merton's bank in the City.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;THE JOURNEY.</h3>

<p>Mr Merton was sitting in the private office of
his counting-house with a large book open before
him. Just as he was in the middle of some calculation
which, to judge from the expression of his
face, was pretty abstruse, the door opened and a
clerk entered. The banker looked up with no
appearance of being pleased at the interruption.</p>

<p>'What is it, Mr Chester?' he said, rather angrily.</p>

<p>'There is a young lady, sir, who says she must
see you as soon as possible, and alone.'</p>

<p>'O nonsense. I can't possibly attend to her.
Don't you know who she is?'</p>

<p>'No, sir; she wouldn't give me her name, nor
tell me her business. I said that I was sure you
couldn't see her; but she said it was absolutely
necessary that you should do so, and that you
would know her directly.'</p>

<p>'You must tell her that it is out of the question
for me to see her, if she will not send word who she
is, or what she wants.'</p>

<p>'There's no good, sir; I have told her so. But
she is quite determined to come; and I thought I
had better speak to you, as it seemed so strange
to have her waiting about there.'</p>

<p>'Well, in that case I suppose you must shew
her in.'</p>

<p>The clerk withdrew, and in an instant returned
with a young lady who had a thick veil over her
face. Having ushered her into the room, he withdrew
and shut the door, leaving Mr Merton and
his visitor alone.</p>

<p>No sooner was the door closed than the lady put
up her veil and disclosed the features of Mabel
Colherne.</p>

<p>'Why, Mabel!' said Mr Merton, appearing considerably
more surprised than pleased at finding
who his visitor was; 'what in the world brings you
here?'</p>

<p>Mabel for her only answer put Wilfred's letter
into his father's hands. He read it through without
shewing any signs of either surprise or regret,
and when he had finished it, handed it back to her
without speaking.</p>

<p>'Well, Mr Merton?' she said, feeling impatient
at his silence.</p>

<p>'Well, Mabel?' he returned.</p>

<p>'Have you read the letter?'</p>

<p>'Most certainly.'</p>

<p>'And have you nothing to say?'</p>

<p>'What <i>am</i> I to say?'</p>

<p>'Mr Merton,' exclaimed Mabel, hardly able to
control herself, 'can you read such a letter from
your son, and not care about it?'</p>

<p>'I have given up thinking of Wilfred as my son
at all, Mabel. I gave him the chance of rising in
his odious profession by sending him to Paris,
and what has been his conduct in return for my
kindness? He has done nothing but amuse himself,
and get into all kinds of disreputable mischief.
I should have told you all this before, and tried to
persuade you to break off with him; but I did not
do so; in the first place, because I was sure you
would not listen to me; and in the second, because
I did not want to be the means of cutting him off
from your affection, and thus rendering his amendment
impossible.'</p>

<p>'I have been afraid that something has been
going wrong with Wilfred lately. I wish you had
told me before; I might have been able to influence
him for good.'</p>

<p>'I don't believe that any influence in the world
would be useful to him; he is a thoroughly worthless
fellow. I paid his debts once upon condition
that he would contract no more, but I might have
saved myself the trouble; within a month he
wanted more money. I was not going to be guilty
a second time of the weakness of saving him
from difficulties he had brought upon himself, in
spite too of all my warnings; so I wrote back to
say that I would have no more to do with him.'</p>

<p>'Mr Merton, you will not keep to such a cruel
resolution now, with such a letter as this before you?'</p>

<p>'Are you so weak, Mabel, as to be taken in
by such nonsense as this? Don't you see that being
unable to get at me, he is simply trying what he
can do with you?'</p>

<p>'No, Mr Merton; I don't believe that, and won't
for a moment. I trust my own instinct, which is
a woman's natural guide, and generally a very sure
one, and I am certain that Wilfred intends doing
something desperate.'</p>

<p>'I have told you before now that my son is a
foolish weak fellow, and not worth anybody's love.'</p>

<p>'What is that to me, Mr Merton?' exclaimed
Mabel, exasperated beyond endurance. '<i>I</i> love
him, and I can hardly be expected to stand quietly
by and let him be ruined, because the affection
you ought to bear your son is wanting in your
nature. Who knows but that the treatment he
thus received under his own father's roof may
have'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'What do you wish me to do? What is there
that <i>can</i> be done?' cried Mr Merton, interrupting
the girl's impassioned burst.</p>

<p>'I want you to go with me to Paris to see
Wilfred, that we may take him away from harm,
if it be not too late. If papa had been at home
now, he would, I am sure, have gone with me; but
I could not wait till he comes.'</p>

<p>'You can hardly be serious in proposing for me
to go on such a wild expedition as that, I think?'</p>

<p>'Mr Merton, I am quite sure that that letter
means more than you think; and I am determined
that he shall not be left to be ruined without
an attempt to save him. If you will not come
I must and will go alone.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">{741}</a></span></p>

<p>'You are mad, Mabel! Go to Paris alone, and
to see this worthless fellow! What do you
suppose the world would say of such conduct?'</p>

<p>'I can't think of that when the person I love
best on earth is in such danger, as I am sure
Wilfred is now, and there is a chance, however
faint it may be, of my saving him. I can answer
to heaven and my own conscience for what I am
going to do, and I must brave the world. I shall
write and tell papa what I have done, and I am
sure that he will follow me as soon as possible.
Good-bye, Mr Merton; there is no use in my
stopping here longer.'</p>

<p>'Stay, Mabel!' he began, detaining her as she
rose. 'I cannot possibly allow you to go alone, and
I have of course no power of interfering with your
actions. If you really are bent upon this scheme,
which I still think an utterly mad one, I must,
for the sake of my own reputation as much as for
yours, accompany you.'</p>

<p>'Believe me that my fears are not uncalled for.
I am sure something dreadful is going to happen
to Wilfred, and I only dread being too late even
now. I am very thankful you are going with me;
and am certain that you will never repent it.'</p>

<p>'No thanks: it is only necessity that makes me
do it. When do you start?'</p>

<p>'To-night, if possible.'</p>

<p>Mr Merton looked into a Bradshaw that was
lying upon the table. 'The train to meet the
night-boat leaves London at half-past eight; to
catch that you must start from your house at half-past
seven.'</p>

<p>'I will do that. Will you meet me at the station?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I will be there at a quarter past eight.'</p>

<p>'Good-bye till then; and thank you again a
thousand times.'</p>

<p>Mr Merton attended her to the outer door of the
office, and she drove home well satisfied with her
mission. Writing to her father, to tell him everything,
and what she was going to do, she packed
a small box to take with her, and then did little
else but wish the day, which seemed interminable,
gone. Long before it was necessary, she was at the
station; and punctual to the appointed minute, Mr
Merton appeared.</p>

<p>After a journey that to Mabel seemed endless,
they at length reached Paris, and drove straight
to the hotel in which Wilfred lived.</p>

<p>As they stopped, Mr Merton said: 'You may
depend upon it we shall find our trouble wasted,
and that the object of your anxiety is out somewhere
amusing himself.'</p>

<p>Mabel did not answer. She could hear her heart
beat as she sprang out of the cab; and without
waiting for her companion, entered the court-yard
of the hotel, and went to the den appropriated to
the <i>concierge</i>. That gentleman was reading a newspaper,
in which he seemed much interested, and
did not look up as she came near him.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Merton, est-il chez-lui?' she asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p>The concierge put his finger against the word
he was reading, in mute protest against being
interrupted, and looking slowly up, said rather
dreamily: 'Plaît-il, Madame?'</p>

<p>'Monsieur Merton, est-il chez-lui?' she repeated
more eagerly than before.</p>

<p>The man turned round, and walking with the
most provoking deliberation to the other end of
the room, where numerous keys were hanging,
looked at the place appropriated to the one belonging
to Wilfred's room, and seeing that it was
unoccupied, came back to Mabel and answered:
'Oui, Madame.'</p>

<p>'Quel est le numéro de sa chambre?'</p>

<p>'Soixante-deux, au cinquième,' said the concierge,
returning to his paper as he finished
speaking.</p>

<p>Mr Merton had paid the driver and joined
Mabel as this conversation came to an end, and
they started to mount the stairs to the fifth floor
as directed.</p>

<p>Even Mabel's youth and energy could not prevent
her from getting out of breath in that long
climb; and by the time she and Mr Merton had
arrived at the fourth floor, they were obliged to
stop and rest.</p>

<p>Before they had stood an instant, they were
startled by a loud report of a pistol coming from
the floor above them. With a loud scream, Mabel
sped up the remaining stairs and entered the room
named by the concierge.</p>

<p>Mr Merton came almost instantly after her, and
found Wilfred lying insensible on the floor, and
Mabel kneeling by his side, trying to restore consciousness.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.&mdash;SAVED.</h3>

<p>Within an hour, two of the most skilful physicians
that Paris could boast were with Wilfred Merton.
And when they left him, their verdict was not one
to give much hope. He had shot himself in the
chest, and it was very doubtful whether he would
recover from that fearful self-inflicted wound.</p>

<p>Mr Merton's anguish during those long days
and nights while Wilfred lay at death's door was
terrible to behold. Alienated as had been his
affection for his son while absent, the feelings of
parental love returned tenfold, now that he might
be on the point of losing that son for ever; and as
he nursed his boy with that womanly gentleness
which is so touching in a man, it was evident
that his whole hope of happiness was bound up in
his recovery.</p>

<p>Mr Colherne had, as Mabel predicted, lost no
time in following her to Paris, and though he
could hardly feel the intense and painful interest
in the invalid that his father felt, still for
Mabel's sake he became a willing sharer in the
nursing.</p>

<p>As for Mabel, hope was very strong in her, and
made that time of watching much easier to bear.
She could not help believing that that strong
determination to cross the Channel had been put
into her mind to enable her to save the one who
was so dear to her; and in that belief she put her
trust.</p>

<p>At last, after long, weary, sometimes almost
despairing watching, the patient took a favourable
turn. The burning fever ceased; and one day the
doctor told the anxious watchers that there was
great hope; that indeed, unless any unforeseen
complications arose, there was nothing further to
fear.</p>

<p>Then the pent-up feelings of Mr Merton&mdash;that
grief which he had tried so unsuccessfully to conceal
from his companions, could be kept in no
longer; he threw his arms round Mabel's neck,
buried his face on her shoulder, and burst into
tears, those tears which, when shed by a man, are
so inexpressibly painful to see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">{742}</a></span></p>

<p>'Mabel,' he said, 'I owe all this to you; if it
had not been for you, I should have been my son's
murderer.'</p>

<p>Mabel pressed her lips upon his forehead in
silence; her heart was too full of thankfulness for
speech.</p>

<p>Wilfred was very patient, and manfully bore all
the trials of the time. As soon as he was well enough
to be able to think of what he had done, a feeling of
intense remorse had come over him, and had taken
such powerful hold that at first it threatened to
throw him back. But the gentle hand of Mabel
was a wonderful restorer; a word or two of
loving assurance changed this bitter remorse into
a quiet sorrow. It happened one day, about a
week after this, that while Mabel was reading at
the window of the invalid's room, she heard
Wilfred's voice gently calling to her. It was as if
the voice of her lover had been suddenly restored
to him.</p>

<p>'Can you forgive me, my darling?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Am I not a woman, Wilfred? And is it not a
woman's privilege to forgive?'</p>

<p>'I don't think you are a woman, Mabel; I
think you are an angel.' Few words, but conveying
volumes.</p>

<p>From that moment her lover began to mend
steadily, though still slowly; every day there was
more and more to hope, until at length Wilfred
was pronounced wholly out of danger. And then
one evening in the dusk, when the lamps were
being lighted in the street below them, and the
increased hum and buzz of the later day were
coming on, Wilfred and Mabel found themselves
again alone.</p>

<p>'Mabel,' he said in a low voice, when they had
been quite silent for a long time, 'I have been
wanting an opportunity to tell you all the wrong
that I have done. Shall I tell you now?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Wilfred, now&mdash;in this twilight light.' She
slid her hand into his as she spoke, and they
remained in that position while he told her his
story.</p>

<p>There was nothing new about it; it was the
old story. Led by bad companions into temptations,
his naturally lively and weak nature was
not able to resist; ashamed of himself for his own
conduct when he found himself outrunning his
allowance, and obliged to apply to his father for
help. Thrown into despair by his father's harsh
conduct to him, he had plunged still more wildly
into the excesses and dissipations of his leaders,
till at last, horrified at what he was doing, and
seeing no means of escape from the snares in
which he had allowed himself to be caught, he had
written that letter to Mabel; had waited, vaguely
hoping for he knew not what, for some days, and
had ultimately sought to put an end to himself
in a fit of intense depression. Weakness, that
shoal which is even more fatal, because more
hidden than wickedness, had wrecked him, as it
has wrecked so many. In the deep remorse that
he now felt, he greatly exaggerated the wickedness
of his conduct, for though he had been guilty of
grievous folly, he had done no positive or irremediable
wrong either to himself or others. The
only actual definite sin he had committed was
the suicidal one, from the consequences of which
Mabel's resolution had happily saved him.</p>

<p>When he had finished this history, he paused an
instant, and then added, without looking at her:
'And now, Mabel, that you have heard all this, do
you still say that you forgive me? Can you still
love me?'</p>

<p>'A love would be very useless, Wilfred, that
deserted its object just when it was most wanted;
I hope my love is a truer one than that.'</p>

<p>'Mabel, my beloved,' said he, drawing her
closer to him as he spoke, 'if it had not been for
you, I should have been beyond the power of
repentance now. Your affection has saved me once,
and it shall keep me from harm now, for ever!'</p>

<p>Before very many years had gone by, Wilfred
Merton's name was known as that of a successful
young painter. He and his wife were settled in
London, and were able to live in very comfortable
style. They had no children, which was their only
serious drawback to happiness; but if ever Wilfred,
seeing his wife look longingly at some merry
group of little ones, and guessing her thoughts,
tried to console her, she would put her hand
into his and say, her truthful eyes looking full at
him as she spoke: 'I have you, Wilfred, beside
me, and I am content.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing narrative, which is founded upon
events which actually took place, may be turned
to advantage by those parents who are prone to
thwart the natural inclinations of their children,
or cut them adrift without a proper guide. The
career of many a man has been blighted by the
mistaken, though perhaps well-meant policy of
a father who, desirous to see his son follow up his
own profession, has tried to compel that son to
work contrary to his inclination, with results more
or less disastrous.</p>

<h2><a name="GEMS_AT_RANDOM_STRUNG" id="GEMS_AT_RANDOM_STRUNG">GEMS AT RANDOM STRUNG.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of precious stones, those beautiful
objects which have strongly appealed to the
imagination of men in all ages, has been written
many times; and yet their latest chronicler is
doubtless justified in assuming that the knowledge
of them in its practical sense is not widespread;
that even in the jeweller's trade there
are many who are not skilled in detecting the
real measure of difference between one stone and
another, either by the specific gravity, which supplies
the essential test, or by the minor tests of
rarity and quality. In treating of the history and
distinguishing characteristics of <i>Precious Stones and
Gems</i>, Mr Streeter has certainly conferred a benefit
on 'the trade;' to the general reader the book can
hardly fail to be of interest, for it puts a captivating
subject before him under a variety of
aspects, and appeals successfully to imagination as
well as to taste for exact knowledge.</p>

<p>From the magnificent specimens which the
rescued Sindbad carried away with him when he
tied himself with his turban to the roc's leg, on
through a long succession of fable and of history,
diamonds will never cease to enchant mankind,
having always taken the lead in interest, as they
have been supreme in value among those treasures
of the mineral kingdom which are called gems
or precious stones. Ages before men discovered
that their beauty could be enhanced by handiwork,
their rarity and their price had endowed
them with a surpassing charm; and now, when
handiwork has been brought almost to perfection,
and science has dispelled the mystery with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">{743}</a></span>
the diamond was invested, they maintain their
immemorial supremacy. In company with Mr
Streeter we may trace the beautiful things from
their habitat in India, the Brazils, South Africa,
the Ural Mountains, and Australia, through their
history in the ancient times and in medieval
days, when they formed the theme of many fables
and the object of much superstition.</p>

<p>The diamond dwells in the same lands and in
the same strata with many other gems, but it is
the most precious as it is the most difficult to find;
and though its nature resembles theirs in many
respects, in one it is unique&mdash;it is the hardest of
all known substances, and belongs to those bodies
which refract light most strongly. Its magnifying
power is greater than that of glass; but it is seldom
used for microscopic lenses, owing to the great
difficulty of making them perfectly accurate. It
was believed to possess double refraction, but that
has been disproved; and the deviation which gave
rise to the error is traced to the existence of
internal air-bubbles, as in amber, by which the
course of the light is altered. It is the triumph
of cutting to exhibit these qualities to the highest
degree, and thus did Babinet, a great authority on
diamonds, test them. 'In a sheet of white paper
he bored a hole somewhat larger than the diamond
to be tested: he let a ray of sunlight
pass through the hole, and holding the diamond
a little distance from it, yet at such an angle
as to allow the ray to alight on a point of the flat
facet, he found this facet to be forthwith represented
on the paper as a white figure, whilst all
around little rainbow circles were delineated. If
the observer found the primary colours red, yellow,
and blue definitely separated one from the other
in these little circles, and if their number were
considerable, and they stood at equal distances
from each other, then he pronounced the brilliant
to be well cut.'</p>

<p>From Mr Streeter we learn that in commercial
estimation, coloured gems stand far behind
the diamond; insomuch, he tells us, that this
stone represents ninety per cent., and the others
altogether only ten per cent. of the quantity
on sale. A hundred years ago, Brazil became
the rival of India in the production of diamonds,
and the finders were the poor mulattos and
negroes, who explored for them the sterile wilds
of Minas-Novas, and sold them to the merchants.
The story of the discovery of these gems at
Bahia is as follows: A slave who came from
Minas-Geräes was tending his master's flocks in
Bahia, and he noticed that the soil resembled
that of his native place. He groped in the sand
and found seven hundred carats of diamonds. He
ran away, and offered the gems for sale in a
distant city. Of course such wealth in the hands
of a slave aroused suspicion, and the negro was
arrested and sent back to his master, who tried
in vain to come at a knowledge of his secret.
At last he bethought him of sending the slave
again to tend his flocks at Bahia, and he watched
him. Again the slave-shepherd groped in the
gem-hiding sand, and the truth was discovered.
Then came numbers of wealth-seekers from
Minas-Geräes and other parts of Brazil, so that
the next year twenty-five thousand men were
diamond-hunting in Bahia, and the amount daily
obtained for some time rose to one thousand
four hundred and fifty carats. The trade was a
prerogative of the Portuguese crown, and Lisbon
was the chief emporium of the gems. The
precious things are of fluctuating value. In
1836 they were very dear; but in 1848 the price
fell; and a few years ago there was 'a glut in
the market,' in consequence of Dom Pedro's having
paid the Brazilian state debt to England in diamonds
instead of money, when the price fell fifty
per cent. in the Leipsic market.</p>

<p>Mr Streeter, who has great faith in the future of
Queensland as a diamond-field, gives a most interesting
account of the discoveries in New South
Wales, that wonderful colony, whose long-delayed
luck has come at last, and from all sides at once;
but dwells at length and with exultation upon
the Cape diamond-fields. 'South Africa,' he says,
'is richer, and its produce is far more to the
purpose of modern history, and to the supply of
the precious stones, which form our wealth of
gems, than the old diamond-fields of the East or
West.' The history of the discovery of gems in
the colonies partakes of the romance which attended
the discovery of gold; and is not free from the
tradition of crime and misfortune, which rests
upon similar revelations in the Old World. Idle
as are the superstitions which impute specific evil
influences to certain gems, it is not to be denied
that there have been many instances of 'fatal
jewels;' and that cruelty, injustice, and terrible
human suffering have attended the rifling of
the earth's bosom for those mysterious treasures
formed by her wonderful chemistry from an invisible
component of the atmosphere. Many of
the strange stories of medieval alchemists deal
with the attempt to make diamonds, and Mr
Streeter tells us of the experiments which have
determined their nature and combustibility. There
is a fascination to the imagination in the following
description of the burning of diamonds:</p>

<p>'In 1750 the Emperor Francis I., at Vienna, subjected,
in the presence of the chemist Darzet,
diamonds and rubies worth six thousand florins
to the heat of a smelting-furnace for twenty-four
hours. The diamonds were found to have totally
disappeared; but the rubies remained, and appeared
much more beautiful than before. In 1771 a
magnificent diamond was burned at Paris in the
laboratory of the chemist Macquer. Hence arose a
great discussion. The diamond had disappeared;
but whither? Had it volatilised? Had it burned?
Had it exploded? No one could say. Then stepped
forward a celebrated jeweller, by name Le Blanc,
who asserted the indestructibility of the diamond
in the furnace, stating that he had often placed
diamonds in an intense fire to purify them from
certain blemishes, and that they had never suffered
the smallest injury.' (This has been done also by
Mr Streeter with similar results.) 'The chemists
D'Arcet and Bonelle then demanded of him that
he should make the experiment on the spot in
their presence. He took some diamonds, inclosed
them in a mass of coal and lime in a crucible, and
submitted them to the action of the fire. He had
no doubt that he should find them safe. At the
end of three hours, on looking into the crucible,
they had utterly disappeared.'</p>

<p>Then appeared upon the scene the famous
Lavoisier, he to whom the Convention refused
a fortnight's reprieve from the guillotine, just
as he was on the threshold of a probably sublime
discovery in the science of light; Fouquier-Tinville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">{744}</a></span>
returning him for answer that the
Republic had no need of chemists and <i>savants</i>.
In the presence of Lavoisier, Maillard, another
jeweller, took three diamonds and closely packed
them in powdered charcoal in an earthen pipe-bowl
in a strong fire; and when the pot was
taken out, there lay the diamonds in the powdered
charcoal untouched. It was, however, gradually
discovered that it was only by entirely shutting
out the air, and therefore the oxygen with which
the carbon combines, that the diamonds were
preserved from burning; whereas by the simple
admission of air, of which oxygen is a constituent
part, diamonds burn just the same as common
coal. This was proved by Lavoisier in 1776; and
Davy subsequently shewed that the diamond contains
no hydrogen. So, when the most precious
object which the earth produces is burned, the
gas formed from its combustion is just that which
our fires and our gas-burners yield, and our own
bodies too, by the combustion which attends
their living; and, says Mr Streeter, 'the old fable
of the maiden from whose lips fell diamonds,
may have a really scientific basis after all.' It
takes immense heat to burn a diamond, and if it
were possible to collect the black material which
covers the surface during the process, it would
be found to be simply soot.</p>

<p>The origin of the diamond is still a matter of
scientific investigation and dispute; and the various
opinions concerning it may be collected under
two heads: (1) The diamond is formed immediately
from carbon or carbonic acid by the action
of heat. (2) It is formed from the gradual decomposition
of vegetable matter. The various
methods by which the supporters of the respective
theories suppose the transformation to have been
wrought, are full of interest and suggestion. In
Brazil it was discovered that the matrix of the
diamond is itacolumite, and it is said that the
gems obtained from itacolumite sandstone have
rounded angles and corners, whilst those from
the sandy schist are perfect crystals. 'If,' says
Mr Streeter, 'this be a fact, we must believe that
the agency which changed the sandstone into
itacolumite acted also on the diamond.'</p>

<p>Whether in the mines or by the rivers, whose
'golden sands' are flecked with gems, in rich
Brazil, the labour of procuring these beautiful
gems is great, and large specimens are rarely
found; so rarely, that big diamonds have their
histories&mdash;terrible histories too often&mdash;like heroes
and race-horses. They are weighed by the carat,
a word which Mr Streeter considers to have
been derived from the name of a bean, a species
of <i>Erythrina</i>, which grows in Africa. 'The tree
which yields this fruit is called by the natives
"kuara" (sun), and both blossom and fruit are of
a golden colour. The bean when dried is nearly
always of the same weight, and thus in very remote
times it was used in Schangallas, the chief market
of Africa, as a standard of weight for gold. The
beans were afterwards imported into India, and
were then used for weighing the diamond.' It is
estimated that in ten thousand diamonds rarely
more than <i>one</i> weighing twenty carats is met
with, while possibly eight thousand of one carat
or less may be encountered. An elaborate system
of rewards and punishments is adopted in the
Brazilian mining and river-searching works; but
it is believed that in spite of this, one-third of
the produce is surreptitiously disposed of by the
labourers.</p>

<p>The histories of those world-famous diamonds
the Sancy, the Regent, the Koh-i-noor, the Blue
(or Hope) diamond, and others, have been related
before, and history and romance have dealt with the
misery and crime, the evil passions and the mystic
fancies, involved in the stories of some of these.
In a few lines Mr Streeter gives a sketch of the
Brazilian contribution to this many-chaptered
story, which is not generally known. 'The discovery
of these precious stones in 1746,' he says,
'proved a great curse to the poor inhabitants of
the banks of the diamond rivers. Scarcely had
the news of the discovery reached the government,
ere they tried to secure the riches of these rivers
for the crown. To effect this, the inhabitants
were driven away from their houses to wild far-away
places, and deprived of their little possessions.
Nature itself seemed to take part against
them: a dreadful drought, succeeded by a violent
earthquake, increased their distress. Many of
them perished; but those who lived to return on
the 18th May 1805, were benevolently reinstated
in their rightful possessions. Strange to say, on
their return the earth seemed strewn with diamonds.
Often the little ones would bring in
between three and four carats of diamonds.'</p>

<p>Next to the diamond comes the oriental ruby,
and in former days it was more prized than the
gem, which has a genus all to itself. The ancients
gave immense sums for fine specimens of the ruby
variety of 'corundum,' or aluminous stone. In
Benvenuto Cellini's time a perfect ruby of a
carat weight cost eight hundred crowns, whilst a
diamond of like weight cost only one hundred.
The two most important rubies ever known in
Europe were brought to England in 1875. One
was a dark-coloured stone, cushion-shape, weighing
thirty-seven carats; the other a blunt drop-shape
of 47<sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> carats. Mr Streeter thinks that the
London market would never have seen these truly
royal gems but for the poverty of the Burmese
government; and adds an interesting account of
the estimation in which rubies are held in the
distant Land of the White Elephant. The sale
of the two rubies caused such excitement that a
military guard had to escort the persons who conveyed
the precious packet to the vessel. No
regalia in Europe contains two such rubies. The
smaller was sold abroad for ten thousand pounds;
the larger has also found a purchaser, but Mr
Streeter does not tell us at what price. The great
ruby of the kings of Burmah is said to be as large
as a pigeon's egg, and of wondrous quality; but
is a treasure which no European eye has ever
seen. Very few rubies pass out of the country;
the king is excessively fond of these gems, and
prohibits the export of them. The Burmese
have strange notions about rubies; 'they believe
that they ripen in the earth; that they are at
first colourless and crude, and gradually become
yellow, green, blue, and last of all <i>red</i>&mdash;this
being considered the highest point of beauty and
ripeness.'</p>

<p>The sapphire, the emerald, and the opal (the
last erroneously supposed to exist in India,
whereas it is found almost entirely in Hungary),
the turquoise, and the cat's-eye (a rare variety
of the chrysoberyl, and inferior in hardness to
the diamond and sapphire only), are, each in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">{745}</a></span>
its turn, the subjects of Mr Streeter's lucid and
learned exposition; after which he passes to the
less valuable classes, pearls, onyx, and the gems
used for engraving and other purposes. The
increasing estimation in which the true Ceylonese
cat's-eye is held (it is one of the most fashionable
gems at present, and there are specimens in the
market worth upwards of one thousand pounds),
renders the following particularly interesting: 'In
India the cat's-eye has always been much prized,
and is held in peculiar veneration as a charm
against witchcraft. It is the last jewel a Cingalese
will part with. The specimens most esteemed by
the Indians are those of a dark olive colour,
having the ray so bright on each edge as to appear
double. It is indeed wonderfully beautiful with
its soft deep colour and mysterious gleaming
streak, ever shifting, like a restless spirit, from
side to side as the stone is moved; now glowing
at one spot, now at another. No wonder that an
imaginative and superstitious people regard it with
awe and wonder, and believing it to be the abode
of some "genius" or djinn, dedicate it to their gods
as a sacred stone.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I was a little boy&mdash;I am now an old man of
sixty&mdash;'Aunt Oliver,' as we used to call my father's
widowed sister, was in the habit of paying long
visits at my father's house. She had not long been
a widow; and though past the meridian of life, was
still a beautiful woman. But what made her so
exceedingly popular with all my father's children
was her repeated kindnesses, displayed to us in the
shape of various useful and ornamental gifts, carefully
chosen to suit our several ages and characters;
but above all, her wonderful condescension in
giving up her own pursuits on many a winter's
night, that she might recount to us, as we sat
grouped around the nursery fire, some of the
incidents of her varied and eventful life. She
had been a great traveller in her day, having
been to Rome, and even visited the Holy Land;
and what is more, she had written a book of
travels! a circumstance which caused us to regard
her with a strange curiosity almost amounting to
awe; a feeling on our part which, but for her
uniform kindness, might have detracted from that
universal love we one and all bore towards her.
One of my aunt's adventures made a strong impression
on my youthful mind, and is even now,
after a lapse of half a century, still fresh in my
recollection. Thinking it might serve to divert
those who have a fancy for the humorous, I have
gathered up the threads of the story from the
storehouse of my memory, and now present it
in narrative form, under the foregoing title.</p>

<p class='p2'>My uncle, Mr Oliver Brown, was in the iron
trade; and in connection with his business, which
was a very large one, was in the habit of paying
periodical visits to the manufacturing town of
Bolton, near to which his principal iron-works
were situated. He usually paid these visits alone;
but on the occasion of which I am about to speak
he was accompanied by my aunt, who deemed it
her duty to be with her husband, as it was winter-time
and he had only just recovered from a severe
illness. It was late in the evening of a bleak
November day that the coach which conveyed Mr
and Mrs Oliver Brown from their comfortable
country-seat, distant some fifty miles from Bolton,
entered the noisy ill-paved streets of that bustling
town, and proceeded to what at that period was
the principal inn of the place. Both travellers
were tired by their journey, and after a hasty
dinner, were glad to retire to rest.</p>

<p>'Did you say number twenty-seven, second
floor?' inquired Mrs Oliver, addressing the lady at
the bar, as she took a chamber candlestick from
her hand and proceeded to mount the stairs.</p>

<p>'Twenty-seven, second floor,' responded the
landlady with an affirmative nod and a gracious
smile.</p>

<p>'Twenty-seven, second floor,' repeated my uncle
as he followed in the wake of his more active and
enterprising helpmate, who, threading her way up
the spiral staircase and along a labyrinth of corridors
and passages, had already arrived at the
dormitory in question. Mr and Mrs Oliver were
soon in bed; and there we will leave them, whilst
we look in at number twenty-nine on the same floor,
and make the acquaintance of Mr and Mrs Wormwood
Scrubbs, the occupants of that apartment.
They, like their neighbours at number twenty-seven,
were in comfortable circumstances, and like
the latter, not much given to travelling for pleasure's
sake on a cold raw day in November; but
an affair of business which demanded their presence
at Bolton had compelled them to sacrifice
their ease and comfort, and come to that town on
this bleak November day. Mr Scrubbs had long
been subject to attacks of gout in the foot; and as
he had heard of this disease having a tendency
sometimes to shift its seat to the brain or the
stomach, when it was apt to assume a more serious
type, he had made it a rule to carry about his
person in the daytime, and to place under his
pillow at night, a certain medicine which an eminent
physician had assured him would speedily
arrest any such erratic tendency on the part of
the malady from which he suffered.</p>

<p>Now, on this particular night, whether from
over-exertion, exposure to cold, or some other
cause I know not, Mr Scrubbs happened to be
visited with certain premonitory symptoms of an
approaching attack of gout, whereupon he instinctively
felt under his pillow for the valuable
specific I have referred to. He then remembered
he had inadvertently left it in the pocket of his
greatcoat, which he had thrown upon the sofa in
the private sitting-room into which Mrs Scrubbs
and himself had been ushered on their arrival
at the inn; whereupon, being unwilling to disturb
his better-half, who was in a profound sleep,
he let himself quietly out of bed, and throwing
his dressing-gown over his shoulders, proceeded
to light his candle. Having done this, he gently
opened the door and sallied forth, leaving the
door slightly ajar, in order that he might the
more easily find the room on his return.</p>

<p>It so chanced just about the time Mr Wormwood
Scrubbs was proceeding on the above
mission, that Mrs Oliver Brown, who was too
fatigued to sleep, suddenly recollected that she had
left her reticule with her purse inside it on the
table in the room where she and Mr Brown had
had their dinner; and wisely considering that it
would not be prudent to leave it there till morning,
she resolved to descend to the sitting-room and
recover the bag at once; accordingly slipping out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">{746}</a></span>
of bed, she struck a light, and opening the bedroom
door, stepped into the corridor into which it
led. She then proceeded to assure herself by a
reference to certain figures that were painted over
the door-frames of the several dormitories that the
room she had just quitted was number twenty-seven
and no other; and having satisfied her mind
on this point, she left the door ajar, and gliding
swiftly along the different passages and down
the cork-screw-shaped staircase, soon reached the
sitting-room, whence, having found the bag she was
in search of, she retraced her steps in the same
rapid way, exercising her memory as she went
along by repeating the number of the room to
which she was returning.</p>

<p>Now Mrs Oliver Brown, who, by the way, had
an undoubted bump for localities, had formed an
idea&mdash;and a very correct idea it was&mdash;that number
twenty-seven was the second room on the left-hand
side of the corridor; but on her return, finding
the door of this chamber closed, whilst that of
the one adjoining it was open, she not unnaturally
supposed she might have made a mistake in regard
to the position of number twenty-seven; but in
order to set all doubt at rest upon this point, she
was about to refer to the number on the door-frame,
when a sudden gust of wind sweeping along
the whole length of the passage extinguished the
candle, leaving her in utter darkness. Thus situated,
Mrs Oliver Brown did what most ladies (and
gentlemen also, I think) would have done under
the circumstances: she groped her way along the
passage till she came to the open door of number
twenty-nine, went softly in, shut the door in the
same quiet way, and got into bed, where, being
greatly fatigued with all she had undergone, she
soon fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr Wormwood Scrubbs having
repossessed himself of his gout mixture, had also
returned to the corridor, where seeing a door ajar
precisely as he had left his own, he at once went
in, closed the door, blew out his candle, and popped
into bed, where my excellent uncle was still sleeping
as peacefully as a baby, and utterly unconscious
of the recent migratory movements of Mrs Brown,
which were destined to produce such an unlooked-for
disturbance in the domestic arrangements of
the two families occupying respectively numbers
twenty-seven and twenty-nine.</p>

<p>Mr Wormwood Scrubbs, however, though now
quite easy both in body and mind, was unable to
sleep, and lay awake, first thinking of one thing
and then of another, till he was suddenly recalled
to the stern realities of life by hearing his wife's
voice proceeding apparently from the adjoining
room. In a state of immense perplexity, he struck
out with his sound leg in the direction of the
sleeping figure at his side, when having come in
contact with a plump warm body corresponding
to that of his amiable helpmate, he paused, and
suspending all further investigation for the present,
calmly awaited the issue of events. Nor had he
very long to wait.</p>

<p>Mrs Wormwood Scrubbs was a lady of a highly
nervous and excitable temperament, with whom,
when once roused, it would be about as useless and
dangerous an experiment to attempt to argue as
with a tigress surrounded by a litter of famished
cubs. She had just waked up from her first sleep,
when happening to put her hand upon that part of
the connubial couch where her Wormwood's head
was wont to rest, she found it brought in contact
with a lace nightcap, and a profusion of long curls
that had escaped from beneath it.</p>

<p>'Why, what's this, Scrubbs? What tomfoolery's
this you're after? What's this, I say?' tagging,
as she spoke, at the head-dress of her supposed
husband. 'Why, goodness gracious, it isn't
Scrubbs after all!'&mdash;as starting up in bed, my aunt
in gentle but startled accents implored her to be
quiet.</p>

<p>'But who are you? and what are you doing in
number twenty-nine?'</p>

<p>'Number twenty-nine! Surely this is not
twenty-nine, but twenty-seven,' doubtingly returned
my aunt, as the idea suddenly flashed upon
her that she <i>might</i> have mistaken the one room for
the other. 'I think I can explain it all.'</p>

<p>'Explain it all! Of course you'll explain it all,
and something more than that, before I've done
with you, you good-for-nothing impudent hussy
that you are!'</p>

<p>'For heaven's sake, be calm, my good woman, or
you'll rouse the whole house,' expostulated my
aunt in the gentlest manner possible.</p>

<p>'Don't "good-woman" me!' shouted Mrs Scrubbs
at the top of her voice, as springing from the bed,
she seized the bell-rope and pulled at it with a
violence that threatened to carry everything with it.
Amid this terrific uproar, Mr Scrubbs and his bedfellow
Mr Brown, who had been vainly trying to
make themselves heard from the adjoining room,
suddenly appeared candle in hand upon the scene.</p>

<p>As oil cast upon the troubled sea will instantly
reduce that element to a state of the profoundest
calm, so did the sudden appearance of Mr Scrubbs
act as if by a charm to allay in one moment all the
angry feelings of Bella Scrubbs, and where only a
few moments before all was violence and discord,
there now reigned perfect peace and good-will.</p>

<p>The mutual explanations that ensued, it is needless
to say, were perfectly satisfactory to all the
parties concerned; and after a readjustment of
partners, the two families once more took possession
of their respective chambers, where I need
hardly say they were not again molested during
the remaining part of that memorable November
night.</p>

<h2><a name="ROCKBOUND" id="ROCKBOUND">ROCKBOUND.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the thousands of tourists who flock every year
from all parts of the civilised world to gaze upon
the picturesque beauties of the Highlands, to muse
among the ruined aisles of Iona, or to listen to
the diapason of the sea, as it sinks and swells
through the pillared caves of Staffa, few, comparatively
speaking, care to go so far north as the
Shetlands; yet these islands, though generally
bare, have a beauty of their own&mdash;the breezy,
ever-changeful beauty of the sea.</p>

<p>The scientific tourist will not fail to find something
to interest him in Shetland. There are
bold headlands, wide reefs of black crags, and
a flora which, although neither rich nor varied,
has charms for the botanist. There are broad
stretches of sandy beach, not so sterile as they
look, but affording, in hidden nooks and crannies,
no bad hunting-ground for a naturalist out for
a summer holiday. If you are a member of the
Alpine Club, there are here no mountains for
you to climb, but there are cliffs such as might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">{747}</a></span>
well appal the most practised mountaineer; and
in summer there is the sun, shining in a cloudless
sky nearly all through the four-and-twenty hours.
There in summer, midnight is not like the midnights
of more southern climes, but is permeated
by the rays of a sun, set indeed, but so soon about
to rise, that there is scarcely any absence of light.</p>

<p>If you are a painter, you may have sea-views in
abundance. You may choose your own time and
place and grouping; early morning if you will,
with the white mists rolling in over the shimmering
sea, and the clamorous gulls hovering above
skerries that are crusted all over with dense clinging
masses of sea-weed. Or you may wait till the
ascending sun rolls back the curtain of mist, and
the sea gleams out before you a wide sheet of
burnished gold, spangled with the rocky islets of
a storm-swept archipelago. The waves roll in at
your feet&mdash;long majestic ridges of water, dappled
with lines of foam; the wide swell of the Atlantic
sweeping in from the far shores of Labrador; while
from far inland some tiny streamlet tumbles down
to the sea through a natural copsewood of dwarf
ash and birch and hazel.</p>

<p>Bold points and headlands stand like brave
sentinels far out to sea, sheltering little natural
harbours where the fisherman's boat rides in
safety. Tiny fiords run inland into deep glens,
with here and there a fisherman's hut or a
crofter's cottage. Perhaps, however, you may
have a fancy for foul weather, when the sky
darkens like a pall over the sea, and the storm-fiend
rouses himself from his ocean lair, and the
tempest-tossed waves scud along in wreaths of
foam to break in hoarse thunder upon the shore,
or hurl themselves in impotent rage against the
face of the steep headland. In Shetland you
have grand alternations of calm and storm.</p>

<p>It is perhaps, however, for the student of human
nature that Shetland has the greatest attractions.
Here he will find a simple, kindly, primitive
set of people, of Norwegian descent, but now
anglicised in language and usages. They are,
however, fond of old legends and stories. Mrs
Saxby, the authoress of <i>Rockbound, a Story of
the Shetland Isles</i>, in a pleasantly told narrative
introduces us to this primitive people. We have
for the scene of the story an island called Vaalafiel,
five miles long, and a little over two in width,
with a tiny harbour, and gray old mansion-house
set in a strip of scraggy pine-wood. Vaalafiel,
Mrs Saxby tells us, 'is coiled upon the sea much
in the way a kitten rolls itself together on the
hearth-rug&mdash;the creature's paws being represented
by the narrow belts of land overlapping each
other and forming the arms of our voe (fiord),
whose crags are very suggestive of claws. Rising
abruptly from the shores of this harbour, the
island becomes a hill, whose eastern side is a
precipice dipping into the German Ocean. The
north point terminates in a bold headland, from
whence the hill slopes gradually southwards, until
it ends in a beautiful stretch of sand, kissed
white by the broad waves of the Atlantic. The
neighbouring islands cluster north and south,
leaving deep narrow channels, where the two great
seas keep up a perpetual warfare; and he is a
daring sailor who ventures to cross those tideways
when their "dark hour" approaches.'</p>

<p>Under the old house of Vaalafiel and the cliffs
adjacent to it were wide underground caverns,
such as in the 'good old smuggling times' were
no uncommon adjuncts to country houses, and
even manses, if they happened to be conveniently
near the shore. This smugglers' cave was the
scene of a tragedy, such as was of no unfrequent
occurrence among desperate men in these lawless
days. A hasty blow struck in sudden passion
hurried one rash soul to its last account, and
darkened as with the brand of Cain the lives of
many others. There is an old nurse, full of
well-nigh forgotten Norse superstitions, and a
little lonely child, the heiress of the rockbound
islet, whose dearest pleasure was to watch the
sea on the serene summer evenings when the
sky became like a poet's dream, and earth and
sea put on the glory of the clouds. Mrs Saxby
describes 'the Shetland summer night as not dark
at all; it is merely a twilight, which is prolonged
sufficiently to assume a character of its own. Not
dark, not light, not a brief uncertain mingling of
both, but a quiet earnest period of rest, when
Nature dreams but does not sleep, and yet is not
awake. We call it "the dim," and you can discern
objects quite clearly while it broods over the
earth.' The wild winter nights have a grand
storm-driven beauty of their own, when the Aurora
Borealis shoots forth a fitful light, and the
nursling of the gray North 'catches glimpses of
the beauty dwelling in colour.' The solitary child
Inga, bearing in her brave little heart the burden
of her father's dimly realised crime, yet cleaving
to him, because he loves her, with an affection far
stronger than that which binds her to her cold
unloving mother, develops into a healthy spirited
girl. Lonely and prosaic as her life was, it was not,
however, without a salutary admixture of holidays
and holiday amusements. The lady of Vaalafiel,
although a somewhat stern disciplinarian, was wise
enough to recognise the truth of the axiom, that
'all work and no play make Jack a dull boy,' and
so upon birthdays and such kindred anniversaries
she somewhat relaxed the rigidity of her rule. A
fat bullock was killed in honour of the young
heiress, and Miss Inga's favourite Newfoundland
dog (evidently desirous of contributing his share
to the feast) went off one night to the hills and
ran down half-a-dozen sheep. It was found that he
had performed the service of a butcher in a perfectly
scientific manner; so the animals were
carried home and added to the larder.'</p>

<p>With such a superabundance of <i>pièces de resistance</i>,
even the crustiest old bachelor in the world
might have found a picnic tolerably enjoyable;
and Miss Inga and her young friends had a most
delightful day of it in their sweet northern Arcadia,
clad as it then was in all its witching garb of
summer. 'The sun,' she says, 'rose in cloudless
glory, and everything was dipped in sunshine
of another kind as well; for Aytoun' (a divinity
student quite as fascinating as <i>The Modern Minister</i>)
'had returned for the midsummer vacation, and
that would have been gladness enough for me.
There were with him some of his college companions,
who made sparkling speeches, sang hearty
songs, assisted in distributing prizes to the winning
boats, and then challenged the islanders to a
football match. Which played best is an undecided
question to this day, for each side had a method
of its own, and did not comprehend that of its
opponent. Then the people were gathered on a
smooth meadow near our house, and the plaintive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">{748}</a></span>
Foula Reel called upon old and young alike to join
in the graceful and truly poetic dance of Shetland.
The natural good breeding of the islanders allowed
us to remove every restriction on their pleasure,
which was characterised by a hearty enjoyment
without the slightest approach to excess.'</p>

<p>As unlike as possible to a heroine of romance, the
child reared in this homely fashion is yet sweet
enough to carry blessing and love wherever she
goes; to heal old wounds with her simple beauty
and goodness; to carry peace into the unforgiving
relentlessness of her mother's heart; and
to efface the blackness of her father's crime
(justifiable homicide, a soft-hearted jury would
resolve it into) with tender penitential tears.
Miss Inga is in truth a very lovable character,
innocent, simple, and yet intelligent; gentle and
winning in her ways, although she can be spirited
and resolute upon occasion; full of affectionate
respect for her stern mother, and of deep romantic
devotion for her father, for whose sake she marries
without love, which no properly constituted
heroine of romance ever does or can do, but which
many a good woman has done, to find, as she did,
peace and household joy and contentment at a
good man's hearth.</p>

<p>Many of the descriptive passages in <i>Rockbound</i>
are written with considerable vividness and effect,
as for instance the storm, through whose agency
a crisis in the plot of the tale is worked out.
'A tempestuous morning was breaking, and sea
and wind were uttering wrathful warnings of what
might befall the unwary fishers who were out
on the deep, and I looked out with eyes which
scarcely saw&mdash;with a mind on which impressions
seemed lost. As if still in a dream, I
beheld the furious waves come rolling majestically
from the far deep and break with thundering
sound upon the rocky arms of our voe. As I
gazed, there suddenly appeared round a point of
the high land a little vessel with closely reefed
sails struggling in the sea between Vaalafiel and
its neighbouring island. Her hull was partially
concealed from my view by the arms of our voe,
but very soon I seemed to know that it must be
the <i>Seamew</i>, and that she was attempting to enter
the harbour; and a thought occurred to me which
was suggestive of peril at once: Why do they try
to pass through so narrow and dangerous a strait
when the storm is at its worst? As if in answer
to my thought, the vessel hoisted a flag of distress,
probably with a forlorn hope that some wakeful
eye might see it, and then she lay to, as trying to
advance in the very teeth of the gale. My father,
everything, was forgotten in that breathless moment,
as I watched my tiny ship thus turn, pause,
and enter the rocky path beset by death. She
was evidently being driven by cruel necessity to
dare so hazardous a piece of navigation, and I soon
discerned that she was no longer manageable.
Just then a gust of wind still more furious than
before caught her at a critical moment, and in less
time than I say the words in, she was tossing
among some detached rocks at the entrance to the
harbour, a total wreck, and likely to go down
every instant.</p>

<p>'I had stood terror-bound till then; but the sight
of figures clinging to the spars stirred me to action,
and I flew to arouse our servants. They were
soon hurrying to the neighbouring cottages, in hope
of assistance from any men who chanced to be at
home; and I ran along the shore until I reached
the crags opposite where the disabled yacht lay.
I was soon joined there by numerous women and
a few old feeble men, who shook their heads
and groaned when I frantically implored them to
launch a boat and go to the rescue. "There's no
an able-bodied man in the island wha kens hoo
to handle an oar," they cried; "oor men are a' at
the haaf" (deep-sea fishing). "The Lord preserve
them this awfu' hoor."'</p>

<p>Then for a touch of simple pathos, take the
neglected child's scanty recollections of her unloved
childhood: 'One of the few things I remember
is that I always wore a black frock. This
circumstance is impressed on my mind, because I
had, and still have, a perfect passion for rich
gorgeous colours. Nature in the gray North
seldom gave my eyes a feast of radiant hues; no
brilliant butterflies and flowers clothing the earth
in the garments of heaven; no winter clusters of
red berries and wreaths of evergreen. There were
some old pictures in the house in which scarlet
shawls and purple curtains played a prominent
part, and I spent a large portion of the time
usually devoted to sleep by sensible children in
admiring these, and conjuring up fantastic histories
of each portrait.'</p>

<p>Altogether, the book is sweet, fresh, tender-hearted,
like a whiff of the foaming ocean spray,
quite out of the hackneyed round, and yet
sufficiently realistic to impress the reader with a
conviction that it is the record of a life which
has been lived, which, if not the highest aim of
the novelist's art, is yet an indispensable adjunct
to it. We have only to add that Shetland is now
easily reached by regular steamers plying between
Granton (Edinburgh) and Lerwick, the capital of
the islands; while we believe a small steamer
plies from Lerwick for local accommodation. A
summer cruise in a yacht would, however, be the
perfection of voyaging for the purpose not only of
seeing Shetland, but Orkney and various intermediate
islands, such as Fair Isle and Foula, which
are out of the way of general traffic. To visit these
distant fragments of land in the north, forming the
scene of Scott's vivid romance of <i>The Pirate</i>, would
furnish a new sensation never to be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Report of the meeting of the British Association
held last year at Glasgow has just been
published in a goodly volume of more than three
hundred pages. Among its contents are Reports
of Committees, of which it may be said that the
more widely they are known the better; and
bearing in mind recent disasters at sea, the Investigation
of the Steering Qualities of Ships by
Professor Osborne Reynolds of Owens College,
Manchester, appears the more interesting. 'The
experiments of the Committee on large ships,' he
remarks, 'have completely established the fact,
that the reversing of the screw of a vessel with
full way on, very much diminishes her steering
power, and reverses what little it leaves; so that
where a collision is imminent, to reverse the screw
and use the rudder as if the ship would answer
to it in the usual manner, is a certain way of
bringing about the collision.' This is an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">{749}</a></span>
fact, for it is well known that collisions have been
occasioned by the very means made use of to
avoid them. And Professor Reynolds says further:
'It appears that a ship will turn faster, and for
an angle of thirty degrees, in less room when
driving full speed ahead, than with her engines
reversed, even if the rudder is rightly used. Thus
when an obstacle is too near to admit of stopping
the ship, then the only chance is to keep the
engines on full speed ahead, and so give the rudder
an opportunity of doing its work. These general
laws are of the greatest importance, but they apply
in different degrees to different ships; and each
commander should determine for himself how
his ship will behave.... It is also highly important
that the effect of the reversal of the screw
should be generally recognised, particularly in the
law courts; for in the present state of opinion
on the subject, there can be no doubt that judgment
would go against any commander who had
steamed on ahead, knowing that by so doing he
had the best chance of avoiding a collision.'</p>

<p>The statements thus set forth are illustrated by
diagrams which shew the position of the vessel
after reversal of the screw, and the position after
steaming ahead. The latter shews that collision
would be entirely avoided.</p>

<p>We frequently read that in future sea-fights the
ram will be relied on for running down enemy's
ships and sending them to the bottom. But where
is the captain at the present day who has had
experience of ramming, and of other evolutions
which will be required in a fleet of steam ironclads
under quite new conditions? Soldiers can
go into temporary camps and get experience in
'autumn man&#339;uvres;' but sailors cannot have
mock-actions and run down ships which cost
half a million sterling, nor venture to try the
eighty-ton-gun on their consorts. Hence there
will be very much to learn in the first great naval
battle.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, Professor Reynolds
recommends that small steam-launches should be
built of wood, each representing the exact form
of one of our large ships, and that with these all
possible man&#339;uvres should be carried out, and
officers make themselves familiar with all the
effects of the screw on the rudder, with all the
conditions of steering, with all the evolutions
requisite to bring about or to avoid a collision,
and with the effects of ramming. If strongly
built of wood, these little vessels would withstand
an experimental blow from the ram.</p>

<p>The value of such experiments would be real,
for it is now known that the behaviour of a small
copy of a ship is exactly the same as that of the
great ship, in proportion to the size. The waves
set up by the launch bear the same relation to her
size as the waves of the ship do to the ship. The
recognition of this law marks an epoch in the
progress of naval architecture. Given a model,
Mr Froude 'can now predict with certainty the
comparative and actual resistance of ships before
they are constructed.'</p>

<p>The Report of the Committee for investigating
the circulation of the underground waters in the
New Red Sandstone and Permian formations of
England, and the quantity and character of the
water supplied to various towns and districts from
these formations, conveys information interesting
to everybody&mdash;for everybody drinks. At Liverpool
there are wells sunk in the New Red Sandstone
which yield more than seven million gallons daily;
at Birkenhead the same; at Coventry, Birmingham,
and Leamington four millions and a half; at Nottingham
nearly four millions; and at Warrington
and Stockport more than a million and a half
gallons every day. The total makes up a large
quantity; but it is nothing in comparison with
the supply which the whole area of the New Red
may be expected to furnish. This area, says the
Report, is certainly not less than ten thousand
square miles in extent in England and Wales,
with an average rainfall of thirty inches, of which
certainly never less than ten inches per annum
percolates the ground, which would give an absorption
of water amounting to no less than one hundred
and forty-three millions three hundred and
thirty-six thousand gallons per square mile per
annum; which, on an available area of ten thousand
square miles, gives an annual absorption of
nearly a billion and a half of gallons in England
and Wales. As if to heighten the effect of this
good news, we are told the 'New Red Sandstone
Rock constitutes one of the most effective filtering
media known.... It exerts a powerful oxidising
influence on the dissolved organic matter, which
percolates it to such an extent, that in the waters
of certain deep wells, every trace of organic matters
is converted into innocuous mineral compounds.'
And again: 'Waters drawn from deep wells in the
New Red Sandstone are almost invariably clear,
sparkling, and palatable, and are among the best
and most wholesome waters for domestic supply in
Great Britain.' After reading this, may we not say
that Undermere, about which no one will quarrel,
is the lake whence great towns in the north should
draw their water supply?</p>

<p>During the meeting of the British Association at
Plymouth last August, the Mineralogical Society
held their second annual gathering under the presidency
of Mr Sorby, F.R.S., who in his address
gave an account of a new method for determining
the index of refraction of minerals, which can be
readily employed in their identification. This
seems a dry subject; but it is one likely to be
valuable and interesting to mineralogists and
chemists, and to lead to an entirely new branch
of mineralogical study, and to the discovery of a
new class of optical properties of crystals. For a
proper understanding of the method, a knowledge
of optics, of mathematics, and other branches of
science would be necessary; but we may state
generally that it is based on the fact, that if an
object, when placed in focus for examination on
the stage of a microscope, is covered with a plate
of some highly refracting substance, the focal
length is increased; in other words, the microscope
must be raised a little farther from the
object in order to restore the focus. The distance
to which the microscope has been moved thus
becomes a measure, which can be accurately determined
on a scale to thousandths of an inch. By
this measure, therefore, very minute differences of
refraction can be determined, and the several
minerals identified; and Mr Sorby, in conjunction
with Professor Stokes, Sec. R.S., has arrived
at certain definite conclusions, which, embodied in
numerical tables, may ere long be consulted by
all interested in the subject.</p>

<p>On this point Mr Sorby explained in his address:
'On applying this method to the study of various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">{750}</a></span>
minerals, the difference is found to be very great.
We can mostly at once see whether they give a
single unifocal image or one or two bifocal images,
and form a very good opinion respecting the intensity
of the double refraction, and easily determine
whether it is positive or negative.... These facts
combined furnish data so characteristic of the
individual minerals, that it would usually be difficult
to find two approximately similar.... It has
been said that in studying the microscopical structure
of rocks it is often difficult to distinguish
nepheline from apatite. But the index of nepheline
is about 1.53, whereas that of apatite is 1.64, and
such a considerable difference could easily be
recognised in a section not less than one-fiftieth of
an inch in thickness.'</p>

<p>The observations hitherto made prove that
minerals may be ranged in classes according to
their refracting power and their chemical composition.
The fluorides are lowest in the scale, while
quartz, corundum, the sulphides and arsenides, are
among the highest. From these particulars it will
be understood that researches into mineralogy
have a prospect of becoming more and more interesting.</p>

<p>As we have a British Association for the Advancement
of Science, so our neighbours across the
Channel have a French Association. It met last
August at Havre, and in a few of its fifteen sections
manifested signs of activity. Among the meteorologists,
diagrams were exhibited shewing clearly
that the 'changes of pressure in the upper regions
of the atmosphere are by no means similar to those
at the surface of the earth; for when the pressure
at the lower station decreases, it rises at the upper
station, and the reverse; or when it is steady at
the one, it rises or falls at the other.' A line of
telegraph for meteorological purposes is now erected
from Bagnères to the Pic du Midi, seventeen miles.
The Pic is nine thousand feet high, and will be an
interesting observing station, in constant communication
with the lower regions. A proposition
was made that the Transatlantic steam-ship companies
should be requested to institute regular
meteorological observations on board their vessels;
and that the captive balloon of next year's Great
Exhibition at Paris should be an observing station.
Paris is chosen as the meeting-place of the Association
for next year, and at the same time a free
international meteorological congress will be held.</p>

<p>During recent years it has been said that the
marshes and saltish depressions in the territory of
Algiers and other parts of North Africa were
once covered by the sea, and schemes have been
announced for readmitting the sea by cutting
channels from the Mediterranean. Mr Le Chatelier,
a French chemist, says&mdash;the existence of the
salts is not due to the drying up of a former sea,
but to the masses of rock-salt which exist in the
mountains. From these the salt is dissolved out
by rain or by subterranean waters, and the saline
solution percolates the soil to feed the artesian
reservoirs which underlie the desert. These
observations will require attention from geographers.</p>

<p>If any apology were required for a somewhat
late notice of Dr Sayre's method of rectifying
curvature of the spine, it would be found in the
fact that among the arts the healing art holds an
eminent place, and has special claims on every
one's attention. Dr Sayre, an American, has this
year visited England to make known his method
of curing those malformations of the backbone
under which many persons remain cripples for the
whole of their life; and now that it is known, the
wonder is that it was not thought of before. In
carrying out the operation, the patient is lifted
from the ground, and suspended by a support
under the chin and back of the head: sometimes
a support is placed under the armpits, and sometimes
the arms are raised. In this position the
weight of the pelvis acts on the crook in the spine,
and pulls it straight; a bandage dipped in plaster
of Paris is then bound round the body; a few iron
splints are inserted in the bandage, and as the
plaster dries, a mould is formed, which keeps the
straightened bones in place. The suspension is
now at an end; the patient is found to be an inch
or two inches taller than before the operation, and
can walk without limping. After a few days, the
plaster-mould is cut up each side, to allow of
removal for washing the body; but the two halves
are quickly replaced and held in position by a
bandage. In some instances six months' wearing
of the plaster-mould effects a cure, and the patient
enjoys an ease and activity never before experienced.</p>

<p>This method of cure contrasts favourably with
the treatment which keeps the patient supine
many weary months. As may be imagined, it
succeeds better with children than with adults;
but even adults have been cured. A case occurred
at Cork, the patient being a woman aged twenty-two,
and requiring a little mechanical pulling to
assist in the straightening; but it was accomplished,
and she walked out of the room two
inches taller than she entered it.</p>

<p>Mr Hoppe-Seyler, a learned German, has published
a paper on Differences of Chemical Structure
and of Digestion among Animals, supported by
numerous examples, which shew that according to
the organism so is the power to form differences of
tissue; and he sums up thus: 'Looking at the
question broadly, we find that the chemical composition
of the tissues and the chemical functions
of the organs present undoubted relations to the
stages of development, which shew themselves in
the zoological system, as well as in the early stages
of development of each individual higher organism.
These relations deserve further notice and investigation,
and are qualified in many respects to
prevent and correct errors in the classification of
animals. It is generally supposed that the study
of development is a purely morphological science,
but it also presents a large field for chemical
research.' This concluding sentence is significant,
and should have serious consideration.</p>

<p>Waste pyrites from the manufacture of sulphuric
acid is, as regards hardness, a good material for
roads when mixed with gravel; but chemically it
is not good. In the neighbourhood of Nienburg,
Hanover, where roads and paths were covered with
waste pyrites, it was found that grass and corn
ceased to grow; and a farmer on mixing well-water
with warm milk, observed that the milk
curdled. The explanation is, that the waste pyrites
'contained not only sulphide of iron and earthy
constituents, but also sulphide of zinc, and that
by the influence of the oxygen of the atmosphere
and the presence of water, these sulphides were
gradually converted into the corresponding sulphates;'
and these, continually extracted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">{751}</a></span>
rain-water, soaked into the soil, contaminated the
wells, and produced other injurious effects.</p>

<p>The want of really efficient names to distinguish
various kinds of manufactured iron has long been
felt in the iron trade. The Philadelphia Exhibition
gave rise to a Commission which, after discussion
of the question, have recommended that
all malleable compounds of iron similar to the
substance called wrought-iron shall be called
'weld-iron;' that compounds similar to the product
hitherto known as puddled steel, shall be
called 'weld-steel;' that compounds which cannot
be appreciably hardened when placed in water
while red-hot shall be called 'ingot-iron;' and
that compounds of this latter which from any cause
are capable of being tempered, shall be called
'ingot-steel.'</p>

<p>By further exercise of his inventive abilities,
Major Moncrieff has produced a hydro-pneumatic
spring gun-carriage perfectly adapted for use in the
field. A gun mounted on this carriage could be
made ready for action within ten minutes after its
arrival in the trenches.</p>

<p>The Science and Art Department have commenced
the publication of a 'Universal Art Inventory,
consisting of brief Notes of Fine and Ornamental
Art executed before the year 1800 chiefly
to be found in Europe.' This is a praiseworthy
undertaking, for there are so many rarities of art
which can never be seen by the multitude, which
can never be moved from their place or purchased,
that an inventory thereof with descriptive notes
cannot fail to be of great utility. Nearly all the
governments of Europe and many royal personages
are co-operating in this work, which includes
reproductions in possible instances. Some of these
reproductions are well known to the frequenters of
the South Kensington Museum; for example, the
great mantel-piece from the Palais de Justice at
Bruges; Trajan's Column from Rome; a Buddhist
gateway from India, of the first century; a monument
from Nuremberg, and other elaborate works.
As a means of reference, this Inventory will be
welcome to many a student, and as it necessarily
will take many years to complete, there will be the
pleasure of watching for fresh instalments of information.
But all students should remember that
'the laws of design are as definite as those of
language, with much the same questions as to
order, relationship, construction or elegance; differing
for dissimilar styles as for divers tongues.
The pupil in design has similar obstacles to
encounter with those of the schoolboy in his
alphabet and grammar; the ability to use the
pencil or the brush will no more produce an artist
than the acquirement of the writing-master's art
with Lindley Murray's rules will make a poet.'</p>

<p>Professor Justin Winsor, one of the American
delegates to the conference of librarians held last
month, points out with much earnestness that by
the extension of libraries a great impetus may be
given to national education, and an opening made
at the same time for the employment of women.
In America, pains have been taken to engage men
and women in the work who are content to labour
to attain the level of a far higher standard than
the public at large have been usually willing to
allow as the test of efficiency. 'We believe,'
remarks the Professor, 'that libraries are in the
highest sense public charities; that they are
missionary enterprises; that it is to be supine if
we are simply willing to let them do their unassisted
work; that it is their business to see
two books read instead of one, and good books
instead of bad. To this end it has been urged
that one of our principal universities shall have a
course of bibliography and training in library
economy.'</p>

<p>In reply to various correspondents, we beg to
state that the information regarding the manufacture
of vegetable isinglass in Rouen, which
appeared under the head of <i>A Few French Notes</i>
in No. 717 of this <i>Journal</i>, was taken from <i>L'Armée
Scientifique</i>, a work compiled by the well-known
French savant, M. L. Figuier. As there seems to
be some difficulty in reconciling M. Figuier's statements
with the present state of the process as
carried on in France, we are making further
inquiry, and hope to be able to give early and
definite information.</p>

<h2><a name="A_FEARFUL_SWING" id="A_FEARFUL_SWING">A FEARFUL SWING.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> 'Shaftmen' at our collieries are selected for
their physical strength and pluck, in addition
to the skill and practical knowledge required for
their particular work. The incident we are about
to relate will shew how severely the former of these
qualifications may at times be tested.</p>

<p>The work of these men is confined to the shaft
of the pit, and consists mainly in repairing the
'tubbing' or lining of the shaft, stopping leaks, or
removing any obstructions interfering with the
free passage of the cages up and down the pit.
The coal-pit at N&mdash;&mdash; has a double shaft, divided
by a 'bratticing' or wooden partition. These divisions
we will call A and B. Two cages (the vehicles
of transport up and down the pit) ascend and
descend alternately in shaft A. At a certain point
the shaft is widened, to allow the cages to pass
each other, and their simultaneous arrival at this
point is insured by the arrangement of the wire-ropes
on the winding-wheels over the pit-mouth.
The oscillation of the cages is guarded against by
wooden guiders running down each side of the shaft,
which fit into grooves in the sides of the cage.</p>

<p>On one occasion during a very severe frost these
guiders had become coated with ice, and thus
their free passage in the grooves of the cages was
interfered with. Before this obstruction was discovered,
the engine having been set in motion,
the downward cage, which fortunately was empty
at the time, stuck fast in the shaft before arriving
at the passing-point. The ascending cage, whose
only occupant was a small boy returning to
'bank,' proceeding on its upward course, crashed
into the downward cage in the narrow part of the
shaft, where of course there was only a single passage.
Though the shock was something terrific, the
steel rope was not broken; as the engineman, whose
responsible position entails the greatest presence
of mind and watchfulness, had stopped the engine
on the first indication of an unusual tremor in the
rope. Yet such was the violence of the meeting,
that both cages, though strongly constructed of
iron, were bent and broken&mdash;in fact rendered useless&mdash;by
being thus jammed together in a narrow
space. The greatest anxiety was felt as to the
fate of the boy, as it was seen that even if he had
escaped with his life after such a severe crash,
his rescue would be a work of great danger and
difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">{752}</a></span></p>

<p>We may imagine the horror of the poor little
fellow while suspended in the shattered cage
over a gulf some four hundred feet deep, both
cages firmly wedged in the shaft, and the ropes
rendered useless for any means of descent to
the scene of the catastrophe. The readiest way
of approach seemed to be by shaft B, the position
of which we have indicated above. Down this then,
a Shaftman, whom we will call Johnson, descended
in a cage until he arrived at an opening in the
brattice-work by which he could enter shaft A.
He found himself (as he supposed) at a point a
little above where the accident had occurred; and
this conclusion he came to from seeing two ropes
leading downwards, which he naturally took to be
those by which the cages were suspended. Under
this impression he formed the design of sliding
down one of the ropes, with a view to liberating, if
possible, the entangled cages and securing the
safety of the unfortunate boy. The hardy fellow
was soon gliding through the darkness on his brave
and dangerous errand. He had descended about
forty feet, when, to his horror and amazement, his
course was suddenly checked by a bend in the
rope; and the terrible discovery flashed upon him,
that he was <i>suspended in the loop of the slack rope</i>,
which here took a return course to the top of the
downward cage!</p>

<p>It will be understood that when the descending
cage stuck upon the runners, as the rope continued
to unwind from the pulley it hung down in a loop,
descending lower and lower, until the engine was
stopped by the meeting of the cages. This loop or
'bight' was naturally mistaken by Johnson for
the <i>two ropes</i>, and he did not discover until he
found himself in the fearful situation described,
that he had entered through the brattice into shaft
A <i>below</i> instead of above where the cages were
fixed. There he hung then, over a yawning abyss
many fathoms deep&mdash;closed from above by the
locked cages&mdash;all below looming dark and horrible.</p>

<p>None of course knew his danger; his hands
were chilled by the freezing rope; his arms, already
fully exercised, began to ache and stiffen with the
strain and intense cold, added to the bewildering
sense of hopeless peril. Good need there was then
that pluck and endurance be found in the Shaftman!
His square sturdy frame and unflinching
spirit were now on their trial. Had his presence
of mind gone or his nerve failed, he must have
been paralysed with fear, lost his hold, and been
dashed into an unrecognisable mass.</p>

<p>But self-preservation is a potent law, and working
in such a spirit he framed a desperate plan
for a struggle for life. The guiders running down
the inside of the shaft are fastened on to cross-beams
about six feet apart. Johnson hoped that
if he could reach one of these, he might obtain a
footing whereon to rest, and by their means
clamber up to the opening in the brattice-work.
How to reach them was the next question that
flashed lightning-like through his brain. This he
essayed to do by causing the rope to oscillate from
side to side, hoping thus to bring himself within
reach of one of the cross-beams. And now commenced
a <i>fearful swing</i>. Gaining a lodgment with
one knee in the loop, he set the rope swinging by
the motion of his body, grasping out wildly with
one hand each time he approached the side of the
shaft. Once, twice, thrice! he felt the cold icy
face of the 'tubbing,' but as yet nothing except
slimy boards met his grasp, affording no more hold
than the glassy side of an iceberg. At last he
touched a cross-beam, to which his iron muscles,
now fully roused to their work, held on like a vice.
He soon found footing on the beam below, and
then letting go the treacherous rope, rested in
comparative security before beginning the perilous
ascent. With incredible endurance of nerve and
muscle he clambered upward alongside the guider,
by the aid of the cross-beams, and by thrusting his
hands through the crevices of the timber. In this
manner he reached the opening into shaft B, where
the cage in which he had descended was waiting.
Chilled, cramped, and frozen, and barely able to
give the signal, he was drawn to the pit-mouth
prostrate and exhausted. The boy was rescued
unhurt by a man being lowered to the top of the
cages in shaft A. Johnson suffered no ill consequences,
and though a hero above many known to
fame, he still pursues his hardy task as a Shaftman;
while beneath the homely exterior still lives
the pluck and sinew of iron that did not fail him
even in his Fearful Swing.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
